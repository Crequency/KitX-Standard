## Usage


## Additional information

### Notice

1. `.g.dart` files are auto generated, you'd better do not edit them manually.
2. Without `.g.dart` files, editor will throw errors and you can not compile project which is normal.
3. Accroding to [documentation](https://pub.dev/packages/built_value#should-i-check-in-andor-publish-in-the-generated-gdart-files), you'd better push `.g.dart` files.
